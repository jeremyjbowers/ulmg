"Ha-seong Kim","SS","KBO",2021,"25.3277777","South Korea",,"SDP",,"5' 9""","175","R","R","50","Med","Kim is an explosive, compact-bodied athlete with natural doubles power who frequently turns on pitches on the inner half and absolutely obliterates balls to his pull side. He took bigger hacks during the 2020 KBO season and hit more homers without impacting his contact rates, as he also had more walks than Ks. An everyday talent who'll be on the overall top 100 prospects list this offseason, it's impossible to say whether Kim will be able to make the leap from Korean to MLB pitching seamlessly, but his KBO numbers are more favorable than other recent successful players, he's younger, and his defensive ability gives him more margin for error in this regard.","PHWfaRLrd4U","sa3011918"
"Jung-hoo Lee","RF","KBO",2024,"22.4861111","South Korea",,,,"6' 1""","172","L","L","50","Med","Like Bo Bichette and Vladdy Guerrero, Lee has elite baseball lineage and seemed pre-ordained for stardom in Korea. His father, Jong-beom Lee, was a superstar five-tool pro ballplayer who stole as many as 84 bases in a single (124-game!) season and had several 20-plus homer years as well (go look at his 1997 line). Jung-hoo is more precocious than the elder Lee and is the first player in KBO history to go straight from high school to the top level of play. 
Since arriving in the league at age 19, Lee has hit for elite rates of contact and in his age-21 season began to hit for power (his early-career pop may have been masked by injury/recovery from shoulder surgery). He's had more walks than strikeouts the last two years while playing excellent right field defense. He also wields one of the sweetest-looking swings on the planet. His frame may limit his power ceiling, but his bat-to-ball skills are very promising and because his pro career began so early, Lee is on track to hit MLB free agency at age 24.","vJX_yikLwQw","kr3012640"

His swing has natural lift out in front of the plate and he has shown feel to hit in games. Based on looks at him in workouts, he is likely to stay at short, where he has plus hands and actions, and average range and arm strength. He is a caliber of prospect commensurate with a mid-first round pick.","PYWpq-V0Jmg",

He's been clocked at 101 and usually sits 97 and up. His secondaries are raw but he'll occasionally show an above-average split and average breaking ball. There was a stretch in high school when Sasaki was asked to throw nearly 500 pitches in an eight-day span, including all of a 12-inning complete game in which he also hit the game-winning two-run homer. He was the first pick in the 2019 NPB draft but the risk associated with teenage pitching is universal. He's in the same FV tier as Mick Abel.",,

While there's not overt power projection on the frame, you can project more future in-game power from Diaz because he's an explosive rotational athlete whose backswing threatens to clip the mask of the catcher behind him. He's arguably a bit safer than some of the other top amateur shortstops in our international rankings because of how he's hit in games.",,

He's built like a wide receiver but is actually fairly short to the ball for someone with such long levers. I had multiple sources tell me he had a positive PED test around a year ago, but now there's dissent among baseball people as to whether or not that's true, and scouts and agents who have sought out an answer have gotten mixed responses. (As an aside, none of the other prospect publications have reported it.) Regardless, it hasn't had an effect on where Pineda is ranked. He's a prototypical right field power prospect.",,
"Cristian Santana","SS","Int'l Amateur",2021,"17.2222222","Dominican Republic",,"DET",,"6' 0""","165","R","R","45","Med","Among the more polished hitters in the class, Santana's swing is compact but dynamic throughout the hitting zone, he has natural feel for all-fields contact and his swing's gentle loft creates power without compromising much contact. He's this year's Placido Polanco comp, projecting to play second or third and hitting enough to profile there.",,

In 2020 (at age-31), his fastball velo gained a tick on average, and now sits parked at 93 mph. It is one of five offerings in Sugano's arsenal, the best of which are his splitter (which he threw more of this season) and a slider that's a 45-grade pitch in a vacuum but plays because Sugano locates it so consistently. He has sort of an odd windup. His torso rotates clockwise while his hips and lower half remain stationary, almost like the two halves of a twisted Oreo coming apart, before things normalize and look like a typical delivery. It's a little deceptive and, along with fantastic command, helps Sugano's average stuff play. He'll likely plug into the middle of a major league rotation immediately.",,
"Cristian Hernandez","SS","Int'l Amateur",2021,"17.1722222","Dominican Republic","Mejia","CHC",,"6' 1""","170","R","R","45","High","A high-probability shortstop with a long-limbed, projectable frame, Hernandez is your traditional international amateur who excels in a workout environment. His infield actions are smooth and athletic, his swing has a gorgeous, pronounced finish, and he has the right amount of overt physical projection that may see him mature into the unteachable, star-making Goldilocks Zone where Hernandez stays at short and also has impact power. The components of Hernandez's swing push and pull against one another, as his cut is pretty long but he also has very advanced barrel control. He's able to pull his hands in and get the barrel on inside pitches and he also has good vertical plate coverage. The downward sweeping nature of the swing might dilute Hernandez's game power relative to his projected raw, but the Cubs have had some recent success in tweaking swings like this.","MnL6q-LWx3o",

He had an immediate impact, clubbing 29 home runs as a rookie and setting a league record for a sophomore-season salary. He has big time, all-fields power and often mis-hits balls into the opposite field gap for doubles. A heavier guy, Kang may be a first base-only athlete by the time he's eligible for MLB free agency (he used to pitch and catch, too, but plays only outfield now), but he's a better natural contact hitter than Sung-bum Na.",,"kr3012665"

He hit the market way back in 2019 when many teams had already committed their pool money, and was rumored to have made a $3.5 million deal with Miami to wait 12 months until July 2nd of 2020 when pools reset. That became a longer wait because of the pandemic.","QPKJomTmAVM",

He was cleared to sign last December but an oblique injury moved back his workout. When it was finally held, teams got a text on the way there saying that Leon had a deal with Houston already done. He hit 15 home runs in 33 Cuban National Series games before a shoulder injury sidelined him. The shoulder is healthy, and with his power, elite arm strength and incredible bat speed from the right side, Leon is the sort of player who would have prompted teams to burst through their bonus pool when they weren't hard-capped. The success rate of Cuban hitters, especially ones who have had a long time away from baseball during their relocation process and pre-eligibility period, is highly variable.",,

His barrel drags through the zone from the left side, making it hard for him to turn on pitches and causing him to pepper the opposite field; his righty swing is more generic. But he gets the bat to the ball from both sides and, though small, is a pretty dynamic athlete who might grow into some pop the way D-backs shortstop Geraldo Perdomo has. Acosta has plus defensive feet, hands, and actions, making him a likely shortstop. If he can make even average contact while playing a good defensive middle infield, he'll have a long big league career.",,

He's hit well in games against US high schoolers while playing sound infield defense at various positions. He's not all that toolsy but does have sneaky power for his size and he's perhaps the most driven, baseball-loving youngster in the class. He looks like a utility infielder if you just evaluate the tools, but scouts love the makeup and think it may carry him to an everyday role.",,

His splitter, which sometimes leaves his hand with slider action, and changeup are the best of his many pitches. Though you'll occasionally see Arihara toss in a lollipop curveball around 70mph, he more evenly mixes a four seamer, sinker, slider, cutter, and the two offspeed pitches. The result is a very deep repertoire of modest quality, pitches that, aside from the change of pace stuff, relies on location to get outs rather than pure stuff. But Arihara does throw plenty of strikes. He has had one of the ten-lowest walk rates among qualified starters in NPB four of the last five years. He projects as a back of the rotation starter.","1QN18dc8f70",

"Armando Cruz","SS","Int'l Amateur",2021,"17.0805555","Dominican Republic","John Carmona/Republik","WAS",,"5' 11""","165","R","R","40","Low","Cruz is the consensus best defensive player in the 2020 amateur class, a flashy and acrobatic shortstop defender. He is not very physical and needs to get much stronger in order to be a viable offensive player, and there's no consensus as to whether he will.

The Braves picked him eighth overall, but flunked his post-draft medical (wrist) and tried to sign him for a reduced amount. During that stretch, the relationship between the player and the team disintegrated and Stewart, who was committed to Mississippi State, chose not to sign. Rather than go to Starkville, he spent a year at a Florida junior college to re-enter the draft, but his stuff took a dive and so did his stock. He made a move to Japan with eyes on pitching there until he's granted unrestricted free agency after six years.

A catastrophic knee injury during an awkward slide cut short his 2019 season, which at the time was rumored to be his final year in the KBO. Instead, Na returned for 2020 and set a career high in homers (34) while mostly DHing. His breaking ball recognition isn't great and he's somewhat whiff-prone, but he is bringing impact power from the left side of the plate to MLB. He profiles as a valuable DH/OF platoon piece, though there's some bust potential here because of the contact-related yellow flags.","q_BsBNMYU8Q","kr3012352"
