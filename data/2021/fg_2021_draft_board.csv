2021,"1",,,"Jack Leiter","SP","21.125","6' 1""","195","R","R","Vanderbilt",,"50","Med","Leiter's fastball has a flat approach angle that plays really well at the top of the strike zone, and he makes very advanced use of both his curveball and slider, which have distinct differences in shape and depth. His glove-side slider command is quite good, enough that it might enable the pitch to play a little better than its raw nastiness. We've seen some good changeups from him in the past but he barely threw the pitch during his freshman season. He has been consistently getting better since high school and was throwing harder in the Fall. Should that continue, I think he'll create some distance between himself and the other top prospects in the class.",,
2021,"2",,,"Kumar Rocker","SP","21.5388888","6' 5""","250","R","R","Vanderbilt",,"50","High","Rocker looked like a first rounder for much of his high school career, but his stuff dipped as the 2018 draft approached while his asking price did not, so teams backed away and Rocker went to college. After a rocky first few weeks of his Vanderbilt career, he became dominant down the stretch, culminating in a 19-strikeout no-hitter against Duke. He made just three starts as a sophomore before COVID-19 ended the season, two strong (vs UIC and UConn) and one not (UCLA). His roller coaster performance during the last couple of years is perhaps a bit of a blemish on an otherwise typical top-of-the-class power pitcher profile led by a mid-90s fastball and plus slider.","i9ljeJlzB5A",
2021,"3",,,"Matt McLain","SS","21.8333333","5' 10""","175","R","R","UCLA",,"50","Low","Perhaps the most polished high school hit tool in the 2018 draft, McLain opted not to sign with Arizona as a first round pick. He's an easy plus runner and plays hard, but had a tough freshman year at UCLA playing in the outfield due to the draft-eligible depth in the Bruins' infield (Toglia, Strumpf, Kreidler); he then bounced back on the Cape and during an abbreviated 2020. McLain knows how to lift the ball in games despite having fringe raw power and his hit/pop combo should be enough to profile at either middle infield position or in center. I consider him a better fit at second base long-term, but there's a pretty large contingent of scouts who think he's capable at shortstop, where he'll likely play all of 2021.","Ei8VE-JkAL8",
2021,"4",,,"Kahlil Watson","SS","18.1388888","5' 11""","168","L","R","Wake Forest HS",,"45+","High","Electricity personified, Watson has perhaps the best bat speed in the entire 2021 draft class regardless of demo (college or high school). He has an up-the-middle defensive projection and the potential for star-level power and speed output. Watson is also a volatile on-field entity, sometimes demonstrative with umpires and hard on himself when he's struggling. He's as high-ceiling a talent as there is in the whole class.",,
2021,"5",,,"Jordan Lawlar","SS","18.8861111","6' 1""","170","R","R","Jesuit Prep HS",,"45+","Med","Lawlar is a complete prospect. He has terrific defensive hands, feet, and actions, enough arm strength for the left side of the infield, and advanced feel to hit and barrel control. He's similar to Cubs 2020 first rounder Ed Howard in that Lawlar is well-rounded and plays a premium position but isn't especially toolsy, but Howard had more physical projection while Lawlar's swing has more natural leverage and loft. Lawlar's ability to impact balls at the top of the strike zone will be valuable in a pro environment that features velo at the letters.",,
2021,"6",,,"Jaden Hill","MIRP","21.4555555","6' 4""","215","R","R","LSU",,"45+","High","Hill was built like a quarterback in high school and had a fastball that sat 90-94 and an easy plus changeup, but he was unspeakably wild and ended up at LSU. He showed occasional feel to pitch as a Tiger freshman and looked to be turning the corner in the weekend rotation when he went down with a strained UCL. He didn't pitch in the Fall but was ready to go for his sophomore spring and was up to 97 in the preseason before being up to 99 during the early part of the shortened 2020 campaign. In addition to his changeup, Hill has two breaking balls (LSU calls them a slider and cutter, but they have more curve/modern slider sensibilities), the best of which is a slider/cutter in the 88-90 mph range. He looks like a late-inning power bullpen arm.",,
2021,"7",,,"Marcelo Mayer","SS","18.4833333","6' 3""","180","L","R","Eastlake HS",,"45+","High","Mayer wasn't at as many national events during the 2020 summer since, like most West Coast prospects, he was farthest away from the Southeast states with loose COVID restrictions where they were held. Working in Mayer's favor is that many decision-making team personnel have already seen him since he shared an infield with former Twins first round pick Keoni Cavaco, and at the time Cavaco was drafted, area scouts thought that Mayer was already the better prospect. Mayer is a graceful infield defender with a very projectable frame. His swing currently prioritizes contact. He has terrific vertical plate coverage and generates all-fields spray, but he's also shown an ability to turn on and punish pitches inside with power. His frame is nearly identical to Izaac Pachecho's, but Mayer has a better chance to stay at short and has more room to fill out, so he's slightly ahead of Pacheco here.",,
2021,"8",,,"Jud Fabian","CF","20.6916666","6' 1""","180","R","L","Florida",,"45+","Med","It's been somewhat trendy for a top prospect or two to skip the draft as a high school senior and early-enroll at their college to reach college eligibility a year sooner, and that's what Fabian did in 2018. He had a good freshman season for a rookie in the SEC then went to the Cape and raked, which continued during his COVID-shortened sophomore year. Fabian has a rare, unfavorable ""backwards"" profile -- he hits right and throws left, limiting him to 1B/OF -- but looks like he'll hit enough for that not to matter. While his lower half has gotten a little heavier and softer since high school, Fabian still has a fairly athletic swing, and his hitting hands work in an explosive loop that give him low-ball power. His hands load deep and high, and Fabian's bat path doesn't always look like it's going to work, but he still covers the zone from (nearly) top to bottom and can pull his hands in to get the barrel on inside pitches, and I think barrel accuracy is tougher to teach than augmenting someone's path. Fabian is a power/speed center field fit if the swing gets dialed in, similar to Travis Swaggerty a few years ago albeit with larger-conference performance.",,
2021,"9",,,"Brady House","3B","18.0055555","6' 3""","200","R","R","Winder-Barrow HS",,"45+","High","House has an ideal frame and is built like a shrunken-down version of Dwight Howard. Some scouts thought he should have reclassified to the 2020 Draft, where he'd have been a likely first rounder at age 17.0. He's deceptively quick as an underway runner and better than you'd think at shortstop given his size, but he should settle as a fringe runner who plays an average to above third base so long as he has the requisite throwing utility to make all the throws. He's up to 95 on the mound and has an easy plus arm, but the separator is easy plus raw power that will likely be a 70 at peak; there's some Alec Bohm or Kris Bryant look to it. The only real nitpicks are that he's a likely corner fit due to the projection and that there's a little stiffness and length to the swing that could mean possible trouble with velo on his hands, but he's basically only been scouted playing kids a year or two older than him and he has performed everywhere he has been.","LgJWO0o1GtM",
2021,"10",,,"Ty Madden","SP","21.2916666","6' 3""","200","R","R","Texas",,"45+","Med","Madden's velocity has been up and down the last few years. He was up to 98 in the Fall before his freshman year, then dipped into the high-80s during the spring of 2019 before he was shut down with a shoulder injury. He was back into the mid-90s during the early part of 2020 and touching the upper-90s during Texas' fall practices. It's unclear whether that velo will hold in long outings or throughout a whole season, something Madden has never proven nor had the opportunity to prove. His delivery is very upright and his arm slot very vertical, so he works with downhill angle similar to a treacherous ski slope. That's not necessarily a good thing, as flat approach angles seem to miss more bats. He has a four-pitch mix led by a projected plus slider.",,
2021,"11",,,"Henry Davis","C","21.7083333","6' 2""","195","R","R","Louisville",,"45+","High","The sample size is too small to be useful, but Davis' 2020 exit velocities are pretty ridiculous, as nearly half the balls he put in play were 95 mph or above. He has considerable power driven by strength in his forearms and wrists, as well as a power-first angle of attack with his bat, rather than whippy, upper-body rotation. It works great for Davis, who also has a 7 arm, a trait that will likely be of greater importance than receiving once this draft class reaches the big leagues.",,
2021,"12",,,"Sal Frelick","2B","21.1305555","5' 10""","175","L","R","Boston College",,"45+","High","A Massachusetts multi-sport prep standout (he was the Gatorade POY in football as a quarterback, as well as a lauded hockey player), Frelick emerged last spring playing outfield and putting up huge numbers for Boston College. He has several catalytic qualities already and might hit for more in-game power later as his swing and approach evolve. Right now Frelick is a slap-and-slash hitter who'll occasionally show you low-ball power. He has good vertical plate coverage and can catch pitches near the top of the zone. It takes projecting on some elements of Frelick's offense to see him as an impact regular, but so much of his skillset is either new or changing (he's also played some second base) and I'm betting on late development here because of the multi-sport, Northeast background and time lost due to a 2019 knee injury/surgery.","IsWJYCo_Gl0",
2021,"13",,,"Max Ferguson","2B","21.7861111","6' 1""","180","L","R","Tennessee",,"45+","High","Ferguson had a quiet freshman year, then had a very loud fall/winter before his sophomore season, with reports indicating he had the foundation of a first round talent. Ferguson has a broad-shouldered, flat-backed, projectable frame and really smooth hitting hands in the box. He's also a good hands and feet athlete capable of making tough plays in on the grass. He's a promising middle infield stick.",,
2021,"14",,,"Ian Moller","C","18.6111111","6' 1""","197","R","R","Wahlert HS",,"45","High","High school catching is notoriously risky; from the last decade or so, only Austin Hedges has come from the prep catching ranks and seized an everyday job. The beating catchers take on their way to the big leagues often dilutes their offensive ability or slows their progress, but Moller has the requisite athleticism and arm strength to catch, and he's also one of the more well-rounded high school hitters in the class, regardless of position. He has incredible hitting hands, which generate a combo of contact (because he's so short to the ball) and impact with lift. His offensive footwork is often ill-timed, but that's a minor, correctable blemish on an otherwise exciting all-around profile.",,
2021,"15",,,"Izaac Pacheco","3B","18.55","6' 4""","200","L","R","Friendswood HS",,"45","Med","Of the non-first base high school infielders near the top of the 2021 draft class, Pacheco has the most obvious route to in-game power production. His swing has natural lift and looks an awful lot like that of Cardinals prospect Nolan Gorman, and Pacheco has low-ball proclivity and barrel accuracy in the bottom of the zone. His frame has sizable power projection, though adding 20-plus pounds probably mean he's likely a third baseman long-term, though he's playing shortstop for now.","vymFfGwMcSo",

Like Wendle, Morissette's bat-to-ball skills and approach are what will likely carry him to the big leagues; he's currently ranked behind similar hitters who have more power projection.",,
2021,"17",,,"Adrian Del Castillo","C","21.6916666","5' 11""","205","L","R","Miami",,"45","Med","The best college catcher in the country typically comes off the board in the top 15 picks, and that projects to be either Henry Davis or Adrian Del Castillo in 2021. Del Castillo had more walks than strikeouts as a freshman while slugging 12 homers, 22 doubles, and playing some third base and right field in addition to catching. He followed that up with a good summer on Cape Cod and start to his COVID-shortened 2020 sophomore year. He's a contact-oriented hitter who peppers the opposite baseline with flares and line drives, so while he has the power to punish mistakes, Del Castillo projects to have a hit-tool driven profile. His receiving and throwing are okay, enough that he'll likely remain a catcher, but he doesn't project as an impact defender.",,
2021,"18",,,"Alex Binelas","3B","21.0277777","6' 3""","210","L","R","Louisville",,"45","Low","Binelas' triple slash line as a freshman (.291/.383/.612) put him in this draft class' first round mix, even though he doesn't have premium physical tools. His peripherals (a 20% strikeout rate, twice his walk rate) were not as dominant, and I was eager to see if Binelas could repeat or improve upon his 2019, but a wrist injury and COVID-19 limited him to just two games. Binelas has ultra-short levers and he's very difficult to beat with velocity. He doesn't have an especially projectable frame and he has middling present power, but if he ends up a 6 or better bat, that's still an everyday third baseman. At the very least, he projects into a strong corner platoon role.",,
2021,"19",,,"Andrew Painter","SP","18.1555555","6' 6""","210","R","R","Calvary Christian HS",,"45","High","Painter is a prototypical prep arm with an XXL frame, premium arm strength, and nascent feel for spin, and like many high schoolers of this ilk, he has a mid-rotation shot if everything comes together. Painter's fastball velocity climbed throughout the summer, and he wrapped sitting 94-97 during his last abbreviated showcase outing. He has three other pitches: a mid-80s changeup, a mid-70s curveball, and a mid-80s slider that has cuttery, horizontal action right now, but for which Painter has good arm-side feel. You could point to Tyler Kolek and argue there's some elevated risk in taking a kid this large in the first round.",,
2021,"20",,,"Joshua Baez","RF","17.9388888","6' 3""","210","R","R","Dexter Southfield HS",,"45","High","Baez is a prototypical right field prospect with big present power as well as frame-based projection, a big arm, and strikeouts that threaten to torpedo his profile. He has a long-levered swing that cuts through the middle of the zone. He plays both ways and is from the Northeast, so it's possible the feel for contact is still coming.",,
2021,"21",,,"Jordan Wicks","SP","21.7638888","6' 3""","220","L","L","Kansas State",,"45","Low","Wicks has arguably the best changeup in the 2021 draft and his fastball, while not all that hard, has traits that enable it to play at the top of the strike zone, though Wicks hasn't yet worked up there with it. His breaking stuff is mediocre but workable so long as those pitches are located well, which Wicks' general feel for strike-throwing suggests they will be. Arizona gave high school lefty Avery Short, a similarly-built pitcher with a similar delivery, just shy of $1 million to sign him away from Louisville because his fastball had traits similar to Wicks'. Wicks has that, throws a little harder, has a much better secondary weapon in his changeup, and a track record of college performance, so he's in line for well above $1 million if he holds his stuff in 2021.",,

He's made consistent contact in the games he's been seen in, though, often to the opposite field. From a tools perspective, Reed is a typical prep center field prospect with high-end speed and a frame on which to dream. He doesn't have the track record of the first round center field types of the last couple years but could grow into significantly more power than the likes of Corbin Carroll or Pete Crow-Armstrong and explode during his senior year.",,

He went to an Iowa junior college for a year before heading to Louisville, where he began 2020 on a tear. Speed, arm strength, and pull power are the carrying tools here, while stiffness in the swing limits his in-game power impact and might make it hard for the hit tool to play consistently in pro ball, causing some to consider him a tweener fourth outfield type. But the tools are loud enough that if the swing ends up working (something we'll hopefully know more about after a full season against good pitching), Usher will be an everyday player.",,

He also generates elite spin on a plus-flashing slider and will flash an above-average changeup. Jobe's fastball has tailing action, so its ability to miss bats is going to be more velo/location dependent than those of his backspinning peers, but there's still a shot for three 55-grade (or better) pitches here.",,
