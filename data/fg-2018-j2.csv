"1","Victor Victor Mesa","CF","22.0","Cuba","Praver Shapiro","",3500000,"5' 11""","185","R","R",1,0,"45+","Med","Once the Gurriel's left Cuba, Mesa was to become crown prince of Cuban baseball. His father, Victor Mesa, is a Cuban baseball pillar and long-time manager of Series Nacional teams and Cuba's Natoinal Team. Like the Gurriels before them, MLB clubs had some doubt that the Mesa boys (Victor Victor and his younger brother, Victor, Jr.) would come to the U.S. to play ball because of the gravity of their family ties to Cuba. They left in May and have not been cleared to sign by MLB yet. We have very little info on the younger Mesa. Victor Victor, though, has been seen. He has been in Series Nacional since age 16, though hadn't played much the last two years there, and played in the Can Am League last summer. He's a plus runner and defender in center with plus bat speed, some pull power and good hand-eye. His body and style of play have been compared to Carlos Gomez and a more explosive Albert Almora. Because most of the money in this year's macro MLB pool has been tied up by early, technically illegal verbal agreements, for a while now, it's not really clear who has the money to pay Victor Victor when he clears. We'll have to see who hasn't spent anything over the next several weeks. He's 22 and it makes more sense for him to get a deal done quickly if the money is available. ","K7KQgt1ZsuU"
"2","Marco Luciano","SS","16.7","Dominican","Ray Castillo","SFG",2600000,"6' 2""","180","R","R",1,1,"45","High","Luciano's broad, square, muscular shoulders look like they belong to a D1 high school football prospect. He has one of the better frames in the class and plenty of room to add power to a body that already produces a lot of it. Luciano has explosive hands and a natural uppercut swing. He hits many more balls out during BP than is typical for a hitter this age and has taken his peers deep in games, too. Luciano's feet and actions are workable on the infield but he struggles with throwing velocity and accuracy when he's forced to throw from a lower arm slot, as shortstops often are. If he can't correct it he'll need to move to the outfield. Luciano's power separates him from most of the rest of the class and he's a potential star if he can stay at short.","wU6imWFo4hM"
"3","Diego Cartaya","C","16.8","Venezuela","Alexis/Dan Quiroz","LAD",2500000,"6' 2""","200","R","R",0,0,"40+","High","This is very physical teenager with some of the best present raw power in the class and a good chance to play a premium defensive position. Cartaya has a strong, physically mature build that inspires Salvador Perez comparisons. He has excellent lateral mobility despite his size and his receiving has been alright, but not great, when he's caught pro-quality stuff at showcases. He checks all the other beloved catcher skillset boxes; Cartaya is poised and engaged with his pitchers, he has a great arm, he looks built to meet the position's physical demands and makes an attempt to frame pitches when he can. There's a chance he outgrows the position but he's deceptively athletic for his size and we'd call it unlikely. There's not as much room for power projection here as there is for most of the others in the class but plenty to profile at catcher. Cartaya's approach is geared for well-timed, pull-side gap contact.","c-LTwTIlv7s"
"4","Kevin Alcantara","CF","16.0","Dominican","Jose Offerman","NYY",1000000,"6' 5""","175","R","R",1,2,"40+","High","Alcantara has arguably the best physical projection in the class and is one of its youngest members. He's built like Lewis Brinson was at the same age but has better feel for hitting. He also has innate feel for lift. Hitters of this size almost invariably have contact limitations. It hasn't been an issue for Alcantara so far but he also hasn't seen much pro-quality velo. If everything clicks he a good CF with power and he has several lesser, yet valuable outcomes that will depend on how much he fills out.",""
"5","Junior Sanquintin","SS","16.5","Dominican","Wilken Ramirez","CLE",1200000,"6' 0""","180","S","R",2,1,"40+","Med","Sanquintin is a stocky, 6-foot-1 shortstop with an explosive first step who has a good chance to stay at short and be an average defender. His hands and arm are both fine there, as well. He has one of the more advanced bats in the class and has some present pop due to his physicality, with room for a little more. This is the second year in a row Cleveland's top two J2 targets have had precocious bat-to-ball skills and limited physical projection.","I0cN4L2seo0"
"6","Richard Gallardo","RHP","16.8","Venezuela","Andres Veliz","CHC",800000,"6' 1""","187","R","R",0,0,"40+","High","Gallardo's style of pitching is in vogue. His fastball plays well up in the zone and rushes past hitters despite fringe velocity and it's compimented by a deep-diving curveball. His frame is modest, but projectable, as is Gallardo's changeup and command due to his delivery's relative ease. He has arguably the best combination of stuff, pitchability and physical projection in the class.","j7EwIoPixuw"
"7","Osiel Rodriguez","RHP","16.6","Cuba","Fausto Mejia","NYY",1100000,"6' 3""","205","R","R",2,0,"40+","High","Rodriguez has the class' most electric arm and he somehow finds a way to throw strikes even though his arm action is all over the place. His arm slot's variability alters the shape and plane of all of his pitches and really isn't sustainable, long term. He'll need to find mechanical consistency to start. If he does, because he pretty clearly has the best raw stuff in the class, he has its highest ceiling.","_Jj3rLa-Lm4"
"8","Gabriel Rodriguez","SS","16.4","Venezuela","Javier Mendoza","CLE",1300000,"6' 2""","175","R","R",0,0,"40+","Med","Cleveland's two high-priced acquisitions last year (Aaron Bracho and George Valera) had advanced bats and limited physical projection, and so too does Rodriguez. He draws mixed reviews at shortstop due to heavy footwork but has plenty of arm and middle infield hands. His chances of staying up the middle are strong and, though his physical tools are quite vanilla, the bat has a good chance to play there.","JQBYAlGbKIw"
"9","Noelvi Marte","SS","16.7","Dominican","Raul Valera","SEA",1600000,"6' 1""","180","R","R",0,-1,"40+","Med","This is one of the more exciting power hitters in the class. Marte has thunderous, pull-side power that should be plus at peak, perhaps more. He has a long, slow leg kick that doesn't add much right now as most of Marte's power comes from pure hand speed and strength. With broad, tapered shoulders and a sizeable lower half, he body comps to Jonathan Schoop. His size prohibits projection at shortstop on its own, and Marte's hands and arm are also problemtatic. Realistically, he projects to third base. He has the raw power to profile there comfortably if he hits.","24XWJlBKDh0"
"10","Francisco Alvarez","C","16.6","Venezuela","Javier Mendoza","NYM",2700000,"5' 11""","220","R","R",0,-2,"40+","Med","Alvarez doesn't have a plus tool, but projects to stick behind the plate, has solid defensive skills, enough athleticism and feel to hit. There's some power, he isn't a base-clogger and he has a track record of hitting, making him one of the safer bets in the class.","TG-p0lUDzpM"
"11","Alvin Guzman","CF","16.7","Dominican","Alfredo Arias","ARZ",2000000,"6' 1""","165","R","R",2,1,"40","High","Guzman has a loose, whippy swing that he doesn't always control, some room to fill out, and among the best straightline speed in the class. He's a rangy outfield defender and likely to stay in center field. His hands have enough life in the box that he might do offensive damage, too.","TJIq3ct8HFM"
"12","Misael Urbina","CF","16.2","Venezuela","Yasser Mendez","MIN",1550000,"6' 0""","175","R","R",0,-1,"40","Med","Urbina is one of the more advanced bats in the class, both from a bat control and physical development perspective. He's also one of the youngest. There's a good chance he ends up in left field due to a lack of top-end speed, and Urbina's power projection is limited by his size. He'll have to hit his way to the big leagues, but that's his best skill.","rflqhRGiZ0I"
"13","Orelvis Martinez","SS","16.6","Dominican","Ruddy Santin","TOR",3250000,"6' 1""","190","R","R",0,0,"40","High","Martinez has a loose, whippy swing with natural lift and present 45 raw power that should grow as he does. He has a good chance to get to most of that power in games because of the swing, but there's disagreement about much of the rest of his future. Martinez has plenty of arm for shortstop but his range and feet may not fit there. There are also conflicting opinions about how much he's going to hit, in part due to swing length. In short, Orevlis is one of the more volatile prospects in this class. He might be a shortstop who hits for power, or a corner guy with contact issues.","yHLBXVb004Y"
"14","Alexander Vargas","SS","16.7","Cuba","Ruddy Santin","CIN",3000000,"6' 0""","150","S","R",1,1,"40","High","Though he's eligible to sign this year, Vargas hit the market late, when much of the finite aggregate pool money was already unspokenly spoken for by other players in the class, so it's possible Vargas waits until 2019 to sign in order to get a better deal. We consider the Reds the favorites to employ him. Vargas has a well-proportioned 6-foot frame with some room for mass. His right-handed swing is much more competent than his left-handed one at present but they're each viable pro swings with lift to Vargas' pull side. Defensively, Vargas' footwork is excellent, his hands/actions are fine and he should grow into enough arm strength to play the left side of the infield, but if he doesn't then he's a better fit at second base. There's interesting raw material here, nothing explosive","1-63oQOd8s0"
"15","Antonio Gomez","C","16.6","Venezuela","Felix Luzon","NYY",850000,"6' 2""","205","R","R",0,-1,"40","High","Gomez is a mature-bodied catcher with a true 80 arm and polished contact skills. He offers little in terms of speed, but is baseball athletic with twitch in his game, including regular 1.85 or lower in-game pop times to second base (65-grade times), as low at 1.70 in showcase settings (80-grade times) and radar reading into the mid-80's in terms of velocity on his throws. His profile depends upon him staying behind the plate since he would be first base-only otherwise, but it looks like he should be fine back there at this point.","UIUzPZR_djw"
"16","Eduardo Garcia","SS","16.0","Venezuela","Jose Montero","MIL",1100000,"6' 2""","160","R","R",1,1,"40","High","Garcia is a well-rounded prospect who has a chance to play everyday so long as he stays at shortstop as his bat, though competent, looks as though it will offer little impact.

"17","Alejandro Pie","SS","16.4","Dominican","Astin Jacobo","TBR",2000000,"6' 4""","175","R","R",1,2,"40","High","Pie is polarizing and very raw on both sides of the ball. One subset of scouts think he just hasn't grown into his body, the other just thinks he's not especially athletic (we fall into the former category). He makes many defensive plays much harder than they need to be and may ultimately need to move to the outfield if things don't get ironed out. He'll also needs a lot of swing work and has already abandoned switch-hitting. Pie checks the frame/twitch/makeup boxes but might need a few years of rookie ball before he really gets moving.

Castillo is a thick-torsoed righty with premium arm strength and a workable delivery. His breaking stuff is inconsistent and needs to be tightened. This is an arm strength/arm action/athlete buy without present feel for spin or physical projection, but Philly has had recent success with arms like this.","gJs16OYmZlc"
