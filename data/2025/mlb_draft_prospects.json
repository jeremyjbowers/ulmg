Ethan is more physical and powerful than Jackson and much more closely resembles their father, seven-time All-Star Matt.

Still adding to his 6-foot-4 frame, he already has plenty of strength and an easy left-handed swing with plenty of bat speed and leverage. He tried to do too much when he got pitched around on the circuit last summer, leading to some swing-and-miss concerns, but he should develop into at least an average hitter with 35-homer pop and plenty of walks.<\/p><p>Holliday moves well for his size and has average speed, though he'll probably lose a step as he continues to mature physically.

Three years later, he's a candidate to become the first four-year college outfielder to go No. 1 overall since Darin Erstad in 1995 and should surpass Asa Lacy (No. 4 in 2020) as the highest-drafted Aggie ever. He set a school freshman record with 21 homers in 2023 before going deep 29 times and leading Texas A&amp;M to the Men's College World Series Finals last year.<\/p><p>Possessing as much raw power as anyone in the Draft, LaViolette is built to crush balls with a quick left-handed stroke, the strength and leverage in his impressive 6-foot-6 frame and a focus on launching pitches to his pull side. He also makes quality swing decisions and established an Aggies record with 64 walks in 68 games last spring. The lone flaw in his offensive game does scare some teams, however, because he frequently swings and misses within the strike zone, even on fastballs.<\/p><p>Remarkably athletic for his size, LaViolette posts solid run times out of the batter's box and is even quicker once he gets going. He played the outfield corners as a freshman before moving to center field last spring, with most evaluators projecting him to spend the bulk of his big league career in right.

He began the year in the rotation but moved to the bullpen when Hudson Barrett got hurt. He was back in the rotation when Matt Ager struggled, helping the Gauchos reach (and host) a Regional.&nbsp;<\/p><p>With the chance for three plus pitches and easy velocity, Bremner has some thinking he could figure into conversations at the very top of the 2025 Draft. His fastball averaged a tick over 95 mph in 2024 and touched 98 mph with good ride, lighting up the radar gun with little effort and with some feeling there\u2019s room for growth and more velocity to come in pro ball. His best secondary offering is his easily plus changeup that some scouts hang a 70 grade on. He\u2019ll throw it to any hitter in any count, and it stays on the fastball plane for a long time with late, hard fade, missing bats at a 46-percent clip in 2024. His 86-88 mph slider with gyro-type shape has improved as well.<\/p><p>Perhaps the only question surrounding Bremner is about durability, as he\u2019s yet to show he can handle a full season of starting. But he throws all of his pitches for strikes and misses bats with all three offerings.

The New York City native who attends Poly Prep announced his presence with authority at events like East Coast Pro Showcase and PG National but often struggled with finding the strike zone. At the Area Code Games, he walked the bases loaded, then struck out the side, which looked like he was turning a corner. That trend continued when he largely filled up the zone and struck out two at Major League Baseball\u2019s High School All-American Game.<\/p><p>A participant in MLB Develops programs like the Breakthrough Series and Dream Series, Sime has been lighting up radar guns for some time. He averaged over 95 mph with his heater throughout the summer and is routinely up to 98-99 mph, touching triple digits at times. The pitch has serious life to it, and he can sink it, with one scout calling him a \u201cpure rock thrower.\u201d The pitch can be so devastating that he hasn\u2019t always needed anything else, but he\u2019s worked hard on his breaking ball. He has feel to spin a 78-81 mph hard slider and landed a good one in the zone in the All-American Game.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The biggest thing holding Sime back is his ability to consistently land his power arsenal in the zone. It was better at the end of the summer, and it\u2019s clear he understands he needs to improve that and the consistency of his secondary stuff to move up boards.
