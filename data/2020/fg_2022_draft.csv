"1","",,"Spencer Jones","1B/LHP","21.1","6' 7""","205","L","L","Vanderbilt","","45","","An intriguing two-way prospect and athlete, Jones had middling tools on both sides of the ball but had one of the biggest, most projectable frames in the draft. Teams hoped he'd emerge during his junior spring, but Jones fractured his elbow early in the season and was done for the year. He'll be a tough sign, but teams who think he could be a true two-way player may be motivated to pay him. He'll sit in the upper-80s on the mound and has a great curveball. Offensively, Jones already has considerable power and will likely grow into more. He's also a massive, athletic target at first base.","",
"2","",,"Brooks Lee","SS","21.3","6' 1""","180","S","R","Cal Poly","","40+","","Lee is a flashy shortstop defender with good bat speed. As is typical for switch-hitters this age, both swings are in need of polish. Projections on the bat vary. Lee is committed to Cal Poly, where his father coaches. He's rumored to be a target of Arizona, Los Angeles, and Tampa Bay in the late first and comp round.","",
"3","",,"Hunter Barco","LHP","21.5","6' 4""","208","L","L","Florida","","40+","","Barco was on the radar early and drawing comps to lower-slot elite lefties in the draft like Madison Bumgarner did when he was a prep underclassman. His velo was around 88-91 with a lower slot most of the showcase circuit, then he showed mostly 90-93, touching 96 mph this spring, sometimes flashing a consistently solid average breaker and at other times struggling to land it. His low-spin splitter is a true plus pitch if not closer to 70. He was shut down late in the season with a shoulder muscle strain but hit 96 mph in a private workout with Milwaukee, so the health scare looks to be behind him. Clubs that like the separator splitter, two-way athleticism, and deceptive velo will bet they can figure out the command/breaker, while others see a lefty with inconsistent stuff and arm slot who relies on a splitter.","",
"4","",,"Maurice Hampton","CF","20.8","6' 0""","195","R","R","LSU","","40+","","Hampton was a hot name over the summer for his loud, 105+ mph batted balls and his big time tools and model-friendly age at 17.9 on draft day. This spring, teams have continues to doubt his ability to hit, with a raw feel to hit that some think may never come all the way around, but power/speed/defense to still project as a low-end regular without a 50+ hit tool.","",
