"1","Jasson Dominguez","CF","16.4","Dominican Republic","Ivan Noboa","NYY",5100000,"5' 11""","194","S","R",2,-1,"50","Med","Hyper-sculpted, switch-hitting athlete who could fit at a number of defensive positions. Has plus tools across the board, including power from both sides of the plate. Has largely been seen in workouts and not against live, high-quality pitching, so we don't know much about his feel to hit but the elements are there. There's perhaps some Mamula Risk here, and Dominguez is physically mature, but we don't know of another 16-year-old on the planet with tools this loud and struggle to think of a historic example.","x6cbWcITk7Q",
"2","Robert Puason","SS","16.8","Dominican Republic","J.D. Ozuna","OAK",5100000,"6' 3""","185","S","R",2,2,"45","High","A physically projectable switch-hitter with infield actions, Puason is very similar to Mets SS Ronny Mauricio when the latter was an amateur, but Puason has shown better feel for airborne contact during workouts than Mauricio at the same age. He has a chance to have plus tools across the board, but there's some industry senitment that in-game aptitude might cause those tools to play down in games. Specifically, there's worry about his approach at the plate, which will be a more problematic if Puason outgrows shortstop.","P07YG46Wi30",

He has a chance to stay in center field but, if he doesn't, he'll likely have grown into sizeable power. Bonus is believed to be around $3.5 million.","fYcFn23SsMI",
"5","Bayron Lora","LF","16.8","Dominican Republic","Hector Evertz","TEX",4200000,"6' 4""","220","R","R",1,-1,"40+","High","Traditional corner OF projection bat with big present raw power and a somewhat mature build. There are some long-term questions about the build because Lora is so big for a prospect his age, but physical maturity also gives him a better chance of moving quickly. Has been compared as a player to Phillies prospect Jhailyn Ortiz, but Lora has a much better body composition. Bonus is believed to be $4 million.","OlExVHQzOzc",
"6","Ronnier Quintero","C","16.6","Venezuela","Jaime Ramos","CHC",0,"6' 0""","175","L","R",0,-2,"40","High","There's been a seven-figure Venezuelan catcher near the top of every international class dating back through 2016, and Quintero is this year's model. He's a little less polished on defense than most of his predecessors but has a plus arm and mature, strength-driven power. He has everyday offensive ability if he can remain lithe and mobile enough to catch. ","iXDTfB6Q7vc",
"7","Jhon Diaz","CF","16.8","Dominican Republic","German Rosario","TBR",1500000,"5' 11""","180","L","L",1,-1,"40","Med","Diaz has more present skill than he does physical projection, atypical for this market. There are teams who consider him a tweener bench outfield type, but we think he's just short, not small, and has a bunch of above-average tools and good baseball instincts.","e4kObJjybzc",
"8","Kevin Made","SS","16.8","Dominican Republic","Jaime Ramos","CHC",1500000,"6' 1""","160","R","R",0,1,"40","High","Made is a familiar type, the pure projection shortstop with actions and contact skills that you can dream on.","",
"9","Yiddi Cappe","SS","16.9","Cuba","Yolfri Sanchez","**MIA",0,"6' 3""","175","R","R",1,1,"40","High","There are differing opinions on Cappe, with some teams enthusiastic about the upside of the lanky, toolsy shortstop and others seeing a workout type with questions on game ability. He hit the market when much of the market had spent their pool money and he's rumored to have a $3.5 million deal with Miami to wait 12 months until July 2nd of 2020 when pool reset. Last year there was a player like this, eventual Yankees SS Alexander Vargas, who had a deal to wait over a year with the Reds until the Yankees got extra pool money to trump the standing offer. $3.5 million is seen as strong enough to likely keep Cappe waiting until 2020.","",

Young for the class and still raw at the plate, with some reports of trouble vs. velocity.","KwU4e2Gwrts",

Baltimore had the trump card to sign him earlier this year and wouldn't top the rumored $2 million price he was offered to wait for July 2nd, 2019.","sTiDFoIUQR4",

Doesn't have a deal, but multiple teams have seven figures of uncommitted pool money and some teams think he'll get $1 million or more. There's two other Taiwanese prospects with a consensus value in the mid-six-figures that are also 18-year-old high school seniors (RHP Lee, SS Ping), but Chen is regarded as the best of the bunch.","Yowi42AX3cc",

He's been into the mid-90's and has some projection, but the offspeed stuff and feel is a bit behind the other arms in the top tier.","YuYJf0WtTmQ",
