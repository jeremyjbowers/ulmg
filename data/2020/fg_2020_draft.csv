He already had two traits we think, together, make for a strong profile in that Martin plays a premium position (and is capable of playing several spots) and has a plus feel for the strike zone. He started hitting for power later in the season, something his selectivity gives him an excellent chance of doing in pro ball because he'll only swing at pitches he can drive. He doesn't have huge physical tools at first blush, but Martin is a sneaky plus runner, had more walks that strikeouts as an SEC sophomore and is an opportunistic base stealer. Were he at a lesser school he might be flying under the radar. We're told he had an incredibly high rate of hard contact (95+ exit velo) in 2019, with nearly the entire SEC having TrackMan units. Some scouts think he's a 70 hitter and by far the easiest player to pick at 1-1 despite possibly just being a second baseman. These standout qualities (hit tool, hard contact, plate discipline, versatile defensively) map perfectly to where baseball is going. Offensively, he's a little ahead of Dansby Swanson, another former Commodore middle infielder who went #1 overall, at the same stage, but the defense is a good bit behind and he's a little lesser of an athlete as well.",,
"2",,,"Emerson Hancock","RHP","21.0166666","6' 4""","200","R","R","Georgia",,"50",,"Hancock broke out in 2018 at Georgia and went from projection arm to keep an eye on to possible top 10 overall pick. He's already has more advanced feel for pitching than former Georgia/Rockies 1st rounder Robert Tyler with comparable stuff: 92-96, touching 98 mph with a plus changeup, above average breaker and at least average command. During his best starts, scouts tell us he sits in the mid-90's, flashes four plus pitches and above average command, but he missed time in 2019 with soreness and skipped the summer, so there's some risk currently of him regularly hitting that ceiling.","LmWTHBZA-20",

He has sublime hitter's timing but only fits as a 1B, as he body comps to Yankees 1B Luke Voit. It's a tough profile, but Tork's track record and skills mirror those of Andrew Vaughn enough to think he'll go near the top of the draft.","3Q4wD3EV960",
"4",,,"Mick Abel","RHP","18.8","6' 6""","185","R","R","Jesuit HS OR","Oregon State","45+",,"Abel has tracked as hoped/anticipated since his sophomore year of high school when he was sitting 90-92 and bumping 94. He's now comfortably in the mid-90s, up to 97, though that's in shorter, showcase outings. His breaking ball has gotten firmer, too. It's now a power slider in te mid-80s but has retained curveball shape. While the velo has ticked up, Abel hasn't filled out a whole lot and remains physically projectable, so more heat may be on the way. He lacks the pitch mix and feel of some of our recent 50 FV prep arms (Liberatore, Winn) but he's on his way toward that kind evaluation.","Eqc625r-XdY",

His fastball has hittable angle and might play beneath its velocity in pro ball, but the angle pairs well with his fading changeup, which Kelley will double and triple up on. He can also dump a curveball into the strike zone, but it's not a dominant out pitch like the change. Kelley's velo uptick has coincided with improved conditioning, and while he lacks overt physical projection, it's possible he'll continue to develop in this fashion. If he holds serve, stuff-wise, he's the type of high school arm typically drafted in the late first round.",,

At his best, Wilcox sits 93-96 and hits 98 with heavy sink, a plus changeup, a solid average slider and above average control. He had a tough college debut but was 95-99 mph later in the year and looked like himself. He lacks any modicum of physical projection and his arm slot is not the type that generates swing-and-miss life on the fastball, but the velo is overpowering.","mUKE04zP5UU",

His size is really the only thing some teams are concerned about, and it's not even clear if that really matters for pitchers as it relates to health. While short, Jones is an explosive on-mound athlete who generates mid-90s velocity. He'll reach the upper-90s and his fastball has big time life, competing in the zone for whiffs. He also has apower, mid-80s curveball, which projects to plus and you can project heavily on things like command and the growth of his repertoire because of the athleticism. Jones would also be a prospect as an infielder and he has shocking pop for his size because of his ability to rotate.",,
